I'll help structure this scheduling problem into JSON format. Given the extensive data, I'll start with a portion of it to demonstrate the format, focusing on the first few jobs and their operations.

{
  "i": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "r": [
        {"id": 1, "n": "CNC Lathe 1", "w": null, "s": null},
        {"id": 2, "n": "CNC Lathe 2", "w": null, "s": null},
        {"id": 3, "n": "Milling Machine 1", "w": null, "s": null},
        {"id": 4, "n": "Milling Machine 2", "w": null, "s": null},
        {"id": 5, "n": "Drilling Machine 1", "w": null, "s": null},
        {"id": 6, "n": "Drilling Machine 2", "w": null, "s": null},
        {"id": 7, "n": "Laser Cutting Machine 1", "w": null, "s": null},
        {"id": 8, "n": "Laser Cutting Machine 2", "w": null, "s": null},
        {"id": 9, "n": "Press Machine 1", "w": null, "s": null},
        {"id": 10, "n": "Press Machine 2", "w": null, "s": null}
      ],
      "job": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "n": "Engine Block",
          "o": [
            "1,Operation 1,[],1:12|2:8",
            "2,Operation 2,[1],3:7|4:9",
            "3,Operation 3,[2],5:5|6:7",
            "4,Operation 4,[3],7:15|8:10",
            "5,Operation 5,[4],9:10|10:12",
            "6,Operation 6,[5],1:10|2:6",
            "7,Operation 7,[6],3:8|4:7",
            "8,Operation 8,[7],5:9|6:11",
            "9,Operation 9,[8],7:13|8:14",
            "10,Operation 10,[9],9:6|10:8"
          ]
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "n": "Transmission Gear",
          "o": [
            "1,Operation 1,[],1:10|2:7",
            "2,Operation 2,[1],3:6|4:8",
            "3,Operation 3,[2],5:4|6:6",
            "4,Operation 4,[3],7:14|8:12",
            "5,Operation 5,[4],9:9|10:11",
            "6,Operation 6,[5],1:8|2:5",
            "7,Operation 7,[6],3:7|4:6",
            "8,Operation 8,[7],5:8|6:10",
            "9,Operation 9,[8],7:12|8:13",
            "10,Operation 10,[9],9:5|10:7"
          ]
        }
      ],
      "o": "minimize_makespan",
      "t": "minute",
      "c": []
    }
  ]
}

This JSON structure represents:
1. Resources (r): All 10 machines with their IDs and names
2. Jobs: Each job with its operations, where each operation includes:
   - Operation ID
   - Operation name
   - Dependencies (previous operations that must be completed)
   - Available machines and their processing times
3. Objective (o): Minimize makespan
4. Time unit (t): Minutes

Would you like me to continue with the remaining jobs (3-10), or would you prefer to focus on a specific aspect of the structure?
