#### **Background**
An automotive component manufacturing plant needs to process a batch of critical parts. The plant has 10 machines with different capabilities, which are used to complete 10 types of parts. Each part requires 10 operations, and each operation can be performed on multiple machines of the same type, but with different processing times. Due to the limitations of the machines' capabilities, some operations may not be available on certain machines.

#### **Task Description**
The plant needs to assign appropriate machines for each operation of the parts and determine the processing order of operations on each machine to optimize production efficiency. The specific goal is to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan) of all parts while ensuring the following constraints are met:
1. Each operation can only be processed on one machine.
2. A machine cannot process multiple operations simultaneously.
3. The operations of each part must be completed in a predefined sequence.
4. If an operation cannot be processed on a machine, the processing time for that machine is considered infinite (unavailable).

#### **Parts and Machines Information**
The plant has the following 10 types of parts (Jobs):
1. Part 1: Engine Block
